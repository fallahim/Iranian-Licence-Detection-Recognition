# Iranian License Plate Detection and Recognition
This repository contains code for detecting and recognizing Iranian license plates using deep learning techniques. The project aims to provide an accurate and efficient solution for automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) specifically tailored to Iranian license plates.

**Features**
License Plate Detection: Utilizes deep learning models to detect the presence and location of license plates within images.
License Plate Recognition: Implements algorithms for recognizing and extracting text information from the detected license plates.
Pre-trained Models: Includes pre-trained models for license plate detection and recognition, allowing for easy integration and testing.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides evaluation scripts and metrics to assess the performance of the detection and recognition algorithms.
Data Augmentation Utilities: Includes utilities for data augmentation to improve the robustness and generalization of the models.
